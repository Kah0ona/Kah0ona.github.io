Hello and welcome! I decided to start my personal blog. I am going to post stuff mostly about software development, and also a bit about enterpreneurship now and then. 

I have no idea yet what the frequency of my posts will be. 

Let's see if I've got what it takes to be a blogger...

Cheers,

Marten
